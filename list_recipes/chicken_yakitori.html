        <img src="./Yakitori.jpg" alt="Skewers of Chicken Yakitori">

        <p>Yakitori (Japanese: 焼き鳥) (literally 'grilled bird') is a Japanese type of skewered chicken. 
            Its preparation involves skewering the meat with kushi (串), a type of skewer typically made of steel, bamboo, or similar materials. 
            Afterwards, they are grilled over a charcoal fire. During or after cooking, the meat is typically seasoned with tare sauce or salt.
