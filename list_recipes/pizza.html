        <h1>Pepperoni Pizza</h1>

        <img src="./pizza.jpg" alt="pepperoni-pizza-img">

        <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
        <p>Pepperoni Pizza originated in the United States, created by Italian Americans. It was made widespread by Dominoes and Pizza Hut as they needed Toppings that would not spoil. Today Pepperoni Pizza is famous around the world and enjoyed by millions.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Pizza Sauce</h3>
            <li>½ (350 gram) can of Tomato Paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <h3>Crust</h3>
            <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
            <li>15 grams of Yeast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups very warm water (50 degrees C to 55 degrees C)</li>
            <li>⅓ cup oil</li>
            <h3>Toppings</h3>
            <li>1 cup of shredded motzarella</li>
            <li>175 grams of pepperoni</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .</li>
            <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
            <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed.</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
            <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 220 degrees C. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
        </ol>
